feed_component_breakdown,"The table below shows what categories of feed ingredient are contributing to the total and digestible portions of your feed. For example, the marine-dominant feed preset is 52.8% marine-sourced ingredients. However, because the plant-derived ingredients within it are higher in protein than fishmeal, 52.2% of the total protein within the feed is from plant-derived ingredients. Plant-derived ingredients are slightly less digestible, however, so overall 52% of the digestible protein comes from plant-derived ingredients."
